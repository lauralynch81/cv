<td><h1>Laura Lynch</h1>
  <p><em>Project Manager</em></p>
  I have 7 years’ experience of asset management for the 5th largest housing association in Scotland, working within 9 local authorities. For the last 5 years as Contracts Team Leader - managing staff, budget monitoring and ensuring H&S and
      procurement compliance. Coming from a background as an architect, this has allowed me to develop a broad range of experience in large scale project management to complement my construction technical knowledge. I am a strong team player who
      enjoys new challenges and continuous improvement to ensure the best outcome of any task.</td>
